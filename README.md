**Python version tested:** 3.11
**Key packages:** pandas, numpy, plotly, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, nltk

## Analysis Overview
- **Data Cleaning:** Schema, integrity, and feature engineering (e.g., usage rates, churn flag, segmentation)

- **Product Analytics:** Adoption, retention, satisfaction, effect size, and statistical comparison

- **Qualitative UX:** NLP-based feedback clustering and sentiment analysis

- **Recommendations:** Data-backed actions for Smart Rec, UI, and onboarding

## Key Findings & Recommendations
- **Adoption:** 97% of users tried Smart Recommendation at least once.

- **Impact:** Higher usage and retention for Smart Rec users (not statistically significant).

- **Pain Points**: Repetitive/irrelevant recs, interface confusion, and slow load times dominate feedback.

- **Recommendations:** Focus on improving personalization, onboarding for older users, and UI/performance fixes.
